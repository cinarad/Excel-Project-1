# ðŸ“Š Retail Sales Performance Dashboard (Excel)

This project showcases a **Retail Sales Performance Dashboard** built entirely in **Microsoft Excel**, using a dataset of over 200 retail transactions for a fictional company. The goal of this dashboard is to provide **clear, interactive insights** into key sales metricsâ€”including total revenue, regional trends, product performance, and monthly sales patterns.

It is designed to support **data-driven decision-making** for sales managers and stakeholders, demonstrating how Excelâ€™s powerful analytics and visualization tools can be applied to real-world business scenarios.

### âœ… Initial Data Preparation

Before dashboard development, the dataset was cleaned and structured for effective analysis:

- **Date Formatting**: Converted the `Date` column to **Short Date format** to ensure consistency.
- **Currency Formatting**: Formatted the `Sales` column to include the appropriate **currency symbol**.
- **Sheet Naming**: Renamed the raw data worksheet to `Retail_Sales_Data` for clarity.

#### ðŸ‘¥ Salesperson Mapping:
To enable more efficient referencing:
- Added a new column: `ID_Salesperson` to the main sales table.  
- Created a **reference table** with unique salesperson names and assigned each a unique ID.

- Used the **`XLOOKUP`** function to match names from the raw data and populate the `ID_Salesperson` column accordingly.
